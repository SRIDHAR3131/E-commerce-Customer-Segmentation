# E-commerce-Customer-Segmentation
This project aims to perform customer segmentation analysis on an E-commerce dataset using the K-means clustering algorithm. The goal is to identify the optimal number of clusters (k) based on the maximum silhouette score and uncover purchasing patterns among customers.

### Dataset Information:
The data was collected from a well known E-commerce website over a
period of time based on the customerâ€™s search profile.

### CONCLUSION:
In E-commerce customer segmentation the k-Means clustering plays major role for identifying the purchase pattern based on customer interest ,Here I used silhoutte score for finding an optimal cluster number to predict the right n_cluster.
After that I split the two types cluster 1 is previlge to moderate customer and cluster 0 is low-set of interest in purchasing
